I follow too many people. There's simply not enough time in a day to parse the thousands of tweets I recieve, much less read all the shared content.  
The fact that I regularly miss great information because I have too much good information is at minimum mildly frustrating, 
and very possibly impeding my main reason for using Twitter, to gather and incubate ideas worth sharing. 

So I decided to prune my list of followers. But first I needed some guidelines to decide who could help me gather and incubate valuable ideas. 

Here's what I came up with: 

1. Knowing what everyone else knows isn't valuable.

2. You're better off knowing what a some people know today but everyone will want to know tomorrow. 

3. Subject matter experts are more valuable than people with a topical knowledge of subjects that don't matter. 

4. The people most valuable to the learning process are those who will engage with your ideas and help you improve them. 

I began going through my followers, eliminating anyone who didn't meet the above criteria. In the process, I ran across a few exceptions:

a) people I know personally (friends, close relatives)
