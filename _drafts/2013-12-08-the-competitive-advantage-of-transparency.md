If there's one thing I enjoy in startups, it's their ability to dramatically change what doing business looks like. 

Startups are the reason unlimited vacations are popular. I'm still not convinced they're good, but they're certainly disruptive, even for exempt employees. (If someone can figure out how to give unlimited vacations to hourly workers and not tank their business overnight, that'll be something else entirely). 

The reason it seems like a bad idea to give non-exempt employees unlimited vacations is that they might use them at inopportune times. You can't have people who don't measure the value of their individual work product deciding whether their schedule allows them to take a paid vacation.

The solution to that is actually insanely simple: Bring every employee in on the decision-making process. Give every employee buy-in so they trust that leadership has their best interests at heart. 

To build that type of buy-in, employees have to care about the health of the company and of their team. They have to believe that management isn't going to fuck them over just to put an extra dollar in their pockets. Essentially, the people at the top have to build a strong sense of trust in the company that's so strong that the average employee thinks about the guys on their team before they think about themselves.

If that concept, considering the guy to the left and the right of me before myself seems familiar, it's because one of the largest American companies practices it and rewards behavior that exemplifies it. I'm speaking of the US Armed Forces. Now I'd like to say that I was clever enough to see the comparison on my own, but in truth I had help. I was pointed to a talk, ["Why Leaders Eat Last"](http://99u.com/videos/20272/simon-sinek-why-leaders-eat-last), by Simon Sinek. It's the best video I've watched in the last six months. You must watch it before you continue reading this.

Finished?

Good, then let's continue. I love many things about this video, but the concept of the golden circle is perhaps the most interesting, and certainly the most relevent in this case. Sinek talks about extending the golden circle of trust such that the individual employee, the airline stewardess in his example, will take a risk to help a customer because she knows the CEO has her back if she tries to go above and beyond. That prospect alone is unbelievably great, the ability to empower every employee to use their individual skills to provide great service is the killer app in building trust and loyalty with customers. It makes them believe that the individual they're talking to has the full weight of the company to provide amazing service. That's powerful.

But to me it still doesn't go far enough. The ability to give an employee freedom to act is great, but freedom without transparency still discourages someone from seeing the impact of their role in the greater organization. The stewardess knows she can provide great service, but how well is she able to judge the effect that service has on making the airline successful? Is it possible for her to see if she's living up to the company standard, falling behind, or exceeding expectations? Is there a way to know if her compensation is commesurate with others doing her level of work? If you want someone to voluntarily put their own success behind those of not just their other teammates but the success of the company as a whole, you have to give them reason to believe that putting the company first in the short term will lead to a greater benefit in the long term.

And that's where transparency comes in. The ability of employees to see if they're adequately paid increases buy-in. The ability to know how salaries as a whole affect the bottom line increases buy-in. An airline who tells stewardesses they can't afford a raise, but doesn't say how much of a hit they'd take by offering one isn't being honest with its employees. It's saying to them, "You don't have the power to understand why our corporate logic is superior." It implies the idea that "if you did know why we made the choice, you'd like us less because we put ourselves first. You might quit as a result." In fact, the people you'd lose were the ones who had the greatest prospect of getting employed at a better company, leaving you with all the employees who are performing so poorly they're worried about changing jobs. So by hiding the logic behind your decision you're encouraging your best workers to quit. 

Which is why I love what Buffer is [doing to promote transparency](#). They're making all salaries and equity public inside the company. They're publishing their monthly revenue figures. In essense, they're showing employees on a month to month basis how the company is doing.
