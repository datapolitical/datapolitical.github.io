DoorDashers,

I'm Chris Nicholson, a Silicon Valley native, a 2009 USC grad, and a technical consultant who's been training almost a decade for this job. My background is a mixture of tech and politics. I've run and worked on almost a dozen campaigns in the past ten years, doing database analysis, event planning, and total campaign management. 

I've thrived in the 70 hour week organized chaos that you find in startups and political campaigns. I've fielded dozens of calls a day, supported volunteers, staff, VIPs, written marketing messages, responded to scores of emails, and been home in time to catch Breaking Bad at the end of a long day.

In recent years, I've transitioned to providing technical help not just for political campaigns, but for small businesses in Silicon Valley. It's given me a broad range of experience serving people from all walks of life, diagnosing all manner of problems and solving them, usually with a combination of the right technology and well-written instructions. 

So why do I want to work for DoorDash in a front-facing, semi-techical role? I want it, to borrow from Vince Gilligan, because I like it, because I'm good at it, because it makes me feel alive. I like helping people get what they want, solving logistical issues to deliver a quality product. I've delivered candidates, I've delivered iPads, I've delivered food. I've done everything possible to execute the perfect experience for my clients. 

And it's level of execution that I bring to the table as your next customer service associate.  I know how to speak with people effectively and solve their problems eloquently, directly, and succintly. I understand the pace of a startup, I've lived it, and I enjoy it. Most of all, I love delivery. Eating good quality food is critical to good health and solid mental acuity. 

Delivery allows you eat well without giving up valuable time required to cook well. It lets teams stay together and focus on big problems, it lets tired single parents come home and spend time helping with homework rather than standing over a hot stove. Delivery makes us more effective people. I want to be part of a team working to perfect such a critical service.
